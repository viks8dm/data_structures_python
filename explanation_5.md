## Blockchain

Used a linked-list for this implementation, with a block-node and pointers to next and previous elements in the list

#### Efficiency

Due to use of linked list 
* time complexity is O(1)
* space complexity is O(n), since append operation has O(n) complexity and that is the main operation in this case
